    <h1>My favourite movie: Shutter Island</h1>
    <p>Shutter island is my all time favourite movie, and in this article I will explain you why it is. The first time I was watching Shutter island I was glued to my screen all movie long. The acting is so good and the story line is very nice. Especially the “plot twist”, this in particular is what made this movie my favourite movie. I didn’t see it coming at all and it is so good to watch. Ive since have seen the movie so much and I still love watching it.</p>
    
    <h2>2 Other reviews about Shutter Island</h2>
    <h4>Shutter Island is at the top of its genre</h4>
        
        <p>Martin Scorsese has done it again. He pays attention to every detail in this film, making "Shutter Island" one of the best suspense thrillers of all time.
        
        Visually intriguing, simplistic and absolutely phenomenal. The story is kept simplistic enough so it doesn't get absurd, but allows for an ending which you probably won't see coming. The film doesn't go for cheap thrills, so although you will be on the edge of your seat you won't get needlessly scared.
        
        The film uses everything at its disposal from breathtaking scenery, to detailed laid-out shots, and to actors at their finest to completely engross you in the film. I loved every minute of it and highly recommend it to everyone. Even if you're not a usual fan of the genre, this film has so much more to it.</p>
        <h4>I Highly recommend this movie to anyone</h4>
           <p>
            Visually beautiful, wonderfully acted, and relentlessly gripping, Shutter Island is a brilliantly unrestrained psychological thriller that keeps its audience riveted throughout its entire duration.</p>
